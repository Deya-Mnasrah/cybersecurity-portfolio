# Professional Statement

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Wuppertal with a strong interest in cybersecurity and secure system design. I am motivated by the responsibility of protecting data, systems, and organizational operations against security risks and real-world threats.

Through my academic studies and hands-on work experience, I have developed strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and a high sense of responsibility when working with sensitive data. I value integrity, accountability, and privacy protection, and I believe ethical decision-making is essential in the cybersecurity profession.

My goal is to continue developing practical cybersecurity skills and contribute to an organization by supporting risk management, data protection, and secure system operations, while continuously learning and growing as a security professional.
